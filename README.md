## Mapbox GL Leaflet

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mapbox/mapbox-gl-leaflet.png)](http://travis-ci.org/mapbox/mapbox-gl-leaflet)

This is a binding from [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) to the familiar
[Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) API.

## Compatibility
This branch is compatible with Leaflet 0.7.x versions. For a version compatible with leaflet 1.x, please check out the master branch of this project.

This branch is compatible with early versions of mapbox-gl-js and might break as mapbox makes changes on the project. The master branch keeps compatibility with recent releases of mapbox-gl-js (>12)
